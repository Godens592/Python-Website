        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Guyana, a small South American country, has faced significant development challenges over the past few decades. This case study examines Guyana's progress in human development from 1990 to 2019, identifying key areas of improvement and persistent challenges.</p>
        
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>How has Guyana's human development progressed over the past three decades, and what strategies can be implemented to address remaining challenges and further improve the country's Human Development Index?</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding Key Terms</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Human Development Index (HDI):</strong> The HDI is a composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human developmentâ€”life expectancy, education, and per capita income. It provides a broader understanding of well-being beyond economic growth alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita:</strong> GNI per capita is the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country, divided by the population. It includes the value of all goods and services produced within a country (GDP), plus net income from abroad. This metric is often adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) to allow comparisons between countries.
        </p>
        
        <h3>1. Overview of Guyana's HDI Progress</h3>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="hdi_over_time.png" alt="HDI Over Time Graph">
        </div>
        <p>Guyana's Human Development Index (HDI) has shown steady improvement from 1990 to 2019. In 1990, Guyana's HDI was 0.548, placing it in the low human development category. By 2019, it had risen to 0.682, moving the country into the medium human development category. This represents a total increase of 24.5% over 29 years, or an average annual increase of about 0.76%.</p>
        <p>Despite this progress, Guyana still faces challenges in accelerating its development to catch up with regional peers and reach the high human development category.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Components of HDI: Identifying Areas of Progress and Concern</h3>
        <p>
            The HDI is composed of three dimensions:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health:</strong> Measured by life expectancy at birth, indicating the ability to live a long and healthy life.</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Assessed by mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and older and expected years of schooling for children of school-entering age.</li>
                <li><strong>Standard of Living:</strong> Gauged by GNI per capita (PPP), which adjusts income figures for differences in the cost of living between countries.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="hdi_components_area.png" alt="HDI Components Stacked Area Chart">
        </div>
        <p>The HDI is composed of three dimensions: health, education, and standard of living. This stacked area chart reveals that while all components have improved, they've done so at different rates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Income Index has shown the most significant improvement, particularly after 2000, likely due to economic reforms and growth in key sectors.</li>
            <li>The Education Index has seen steady but slower growth, indicating a need for further investment in this area.</li>
            <li>The Life Expectancy Index has improved consistently but remains the lowest of the three components, suggesting that health outcomes are a critical area for future focus.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Comparative Analysis of HDI Progress</h3>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="hdi_comparison_bar.png" alt="HDI Comparison Bar Chart">
        </div>
        <p>This bar chart provides a clear visualization of Guyana's HDI progress at decade intervals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1990-2000: The most significant improvement, with HDI increasing from 0.548 to 0.616, a 12.4% rise.</li>
            <li>2000-2010: Slower progress, with HDI reaching 0.649, a 5.4% increase.</li>
            <li>2010-2019: Continued steady growth, reaching 0.682, a 5.1% increase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While the overall trend is positive, the slowing rate of improvement in recent decades suggests a need for new strategies to maintain and accelerate development.</p>
        
        <p>In the following sections, we'll delve deeper into specific aspects of Guyana's development, analyze the underlying factors contributing to these trends, and propose targeted strategies for addressing remaining challenges.</p>
